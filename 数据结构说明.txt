PeGS v.2.0 structure and performance\label{sec:pegs2}}

PeGS v.2.0 is a series of Matlab functions that use a shared data structure to step through the inverse method analysis. The workflow (including optional steps) is mirrored by the structure of the software, which is depicted as a flowchart in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}. These functions can be easily invoked via the provided wrapper script ({\tt PeGSModular.m}) or a similar user-created wrapper program. 


\subsection{Data structures \label{sec:datastruct}}

To preserve the modularity of the Matlab functions, we have standardized the input, output and data structures. If new modules are developed for community use, new developers must use the same formatting. Each module has three inputs, a structure containing file parameters, a structure containing module parameters, and a verbose flag. File parameters includes information used to find files, like the directory and image \textsc{regex}. Each module has its own module parameter structure containing user set parameters needed to run the module. Verbose is a Boolean field that shows the user figures mid-use for quality control. The output of each function is a \textsc{true/false} flag to indicate success of the current module.

\subsection{Image requirements \& pre-processing \label{sec:images}}

As a rule of thumb, we have found that a camera resolution that provides at least 50 pixels/particle is required for reliable fringe-fitting, and that uniform lighting is quite important, particularly  for the polarized light channel. Typically, the unpolarized and polarized light sources are done with two different monochromatic lights, so that each one is captured solely within a one channel of an RGB image, e.g. red unpolarized light and green polarized light.
